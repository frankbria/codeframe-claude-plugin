# Agentic Coding Workflow for "Vibe Engineering"

A disciplined approach to software engineering integrating AI coding agents with traditional best practices.

## 1. Socratic Questioning for Requirements

- Use AI to clarify goals, success criteria, edge cases, and constraints before coding.

## 2. Develop PRD (Product Requirements Document) and Technical Specs

- Draft and iteratively refine requirements and technical specifications with AI assistance.

## 3. Solution/Story Development

- Break down requirements into user stories or technical tasks; have AI suggest logical decompositions and mapping.

## 4. Technical To-Do Lists & Planning

- Build stepwise technical to-do lists and project scaffolding, validated by AI.

## 5. Architecture & High-Level Design

- Collaborate with AI to propose and evaluate architectural plans and integration points.

## 6. Automated Test Development (Test-First)

- Define exhaustive test suites ahead of coding; leverage AI for both automation and edge-case analysis.

## 7. Coding Agent Deployment

- Assign AI agents to code against to-dos/stories, running tests in automated agentic loops.

## 8. Documentation Development

- Use AI to generate or update all relevant documentation in parallel with code changes.

## 9. Review and Version Control

- Apply strict git/version control; use AI for enforcing commit message best practices and troubleshooting.

## 10. Automated Formatting, Linting, and Continuous Integration

- Set up and maintain automated formatting, linting, and CI pipelines, aided by AI.

## 11. Code/PR Review

- Combine manual and AI-assisted code reviews to ensure quality and standard compliance.

## 12. Manual QA and Preview Deployments

- Deploy for manual testing; use AI to suggest QA checklists, but perform critical manual validation.

## 13. Research and Iteration

- Use AI to research solutions and guide technical pivots or iterations when necessary.

## 14. Release Estimation & Strategy

- Leverage AI for effort estimation and planning, but always human-validate final release strategies.

## 15. Deployment and Monitoring

- Coordinate releases and post-release monitoring, using AI tools for alerting and anomaly detection.
